        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold my-4"> What do you mean by REST API? </h1>
        <p class="text-xl px-16"> <b>REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)</b>  is an architectural approach for building web services. It uses standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, to interact with resources (e.g., data) on a server. REST APIs are known for their simplicity, statelessness, and uniform interface, making them widely used for web and mobile applications.
